    <h2>Introduction to Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)</h2>
</p>
<p>
    The Chart below shows how RECs are created by renewable energy generators, and purchased by businesses and home owners to offset the conventional
    electicity generation, with no geographic restrictions within the United States.

    The renewable energy certificates (RECs) are a <a href="http://greenpowercommunity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pcl.png">product</a> from 100% domestic
    renewable Energy generation projects. They represent unbundled renewable energy attributes that originate from green energy production; wind, solar,
    biomass or small-scale hydro. For each REC, the 1,000 kilowatt hours, or one megawatt hour of clean energy you purchase takes the place of a similar amount
    of fossil-fuel or other conventional energy on the grid. In this way, you are doing your part to replace carbon-based energy with a clean alternative, grow
    clean energy production, help create new jobs here in the U.S., and develop greater American energy independence.

For every unit of green energy generated (1 MegaWatt hour or 1,000 Kilowatt hours), a    <a href="http://greenpowercommunity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rec-graphic.png">renewable energy certificate (REC)</a> is produced. Your purchase of a
    REC is directly helping to build a market for renewable electricity. When you purchase RECs through GIGA IMPACTS’ renewable energy certificate program, you
    are taking part in an annual program where you receive 6, 12 or 30 clean energy RECs over the course of a one year enrollment period. This is either paid
    monthly, or annually.

    There is no need to switch electricity providers when you buy a renewable energy certificate. Your home or business continues to receive your electricity
    from your existing utility. As an enrolled participant in GIGA IMPACTS’ renewable energy certificate program , you will still receive an energy bill from
    your existing utility – but now you are offsetting your non-green energy usage with a clean energy product that is 100% renewable and 100% domestic.

    Your purchase is real. All RECs from Giga Impacts will be verified by Green-e Energy, an independent consumer protection program providing certification
    for renewable energy sold to households and organizations. See Green-e.org<strong></strong>
