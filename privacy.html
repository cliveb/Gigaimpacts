    <strong>Merchant Services</strong>
</p>
<p>
    GIGAI MPACTS Corporation (“GIGA IMPACTS”) strives to offer its visitors a secure and safe environment for credit card purchases. Some of the payment and
    fulfillment services offered on GIGAIMPACTS.COM may be operated by third party merchant service providers. They collect personally identifiable information
    necessary to accept and process your order on behalf of GIGA IMPACTS to provide you with information you may request and updates on the status of your
    order, and to assist your purchasing experience. Our merchant service providers collect personally identifiable information from you by "active" means,
    whereby you actively give our merchant service providers, as GIGAIMPACTS.COM's agents, that information when ordering products or services.
</p>
<p>
    Personally identifiable information entered into any of the GIGAIMPACTS.COM payment systems is used only to complete your transaction and never revealed to
    others or used by our merchant service providers for any purpose not authorized by GIGA IMPACTS. Our merchant service providers do not own the personally
    identifiable information they collect. However, as authorized by GIGA IMPACTS, our merchant service providers will provide personally identifiable
    information in response to legitimate subpoenas or other appropriate law enforcement activities.
</p>
<p>
    Credit card information provided to buy services or merchandise is used solely to determine that your card is valid, that sufficient credit is available to
    pay for the purchase and to apply the cost of your purchase to your card when the services are rendered. Credit card information you provide is transmitted
    across the Internet securely using encryption from your browser to our merchant service providers' secure order processing systems. Some versions of
    browsers and firewalls do not permit connection to secure servers. In such cases, you will not be able to connect to the server and therefore won't be able
    to place an order through a secure connection. While no method is completely impenetrable, our merchant service providers utilize state-of-the-art
    encryption technology used in e-commerce today. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently,
    while our merchant service providers are committed to protecting your personal information, they cannot entirely ensure or warrant the security of any
    information you transmit to them.
</p>
<p>
    Please be aware that Web sites that have links on our Web site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of
    those Web sites linked to GIGAIMPACTS.COM are not covered by this privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
    External Service Providers. There are a number of separate services offered by third parties that we refer to as external service providers that may be
    complimentary to your use of the Web site. If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or
    grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. We do not disclose your
    personal information to external service providers unless you provide your explicit consent. With your consent we may provide some of your personal
    information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent our disclosure of your personal information to an
    external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third
    parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services.
</p>
<p>
    Internal Service Providers for Our Operations. We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or
    more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly
    to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that
    prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced GIGA IMPACTS related operation,
    unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect
    information directly from you (such as for GIGA IMPACTS surveys). In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider,
    and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal
    service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    GIGAIMPACTS.COM receives and stores any personally identifiable information you enter on our Web site or provide to us in any other way (such as your name,
    street address, telephone number and email address). Also, if you contact GIGA IMPACTS online, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Such
    information is only known to GIGA IMPACTS when it is voluntarily submitted or posted to us. Wherever GIGAIMPACTS.COM collects personally identifiable
    information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
</p>
<p>
    Personally identifiable information will be used by GIGA IMPACTS and its authorized agents only: (1) to process your requests (e.g., purchase products or
    services); (2) to communicate with you or personalize the Web site based on your stated interests and preferences or make related offers to you; (3) to
    administer the Web site or serve you when you have questions or problems; and/or (4) as may, in GIGA IMPACTS’ sole judgment, be required by any applicable
    laws, rules or regulations or the Terms and Conditions applicable to this Web site.
</p>
<p>
    Personally identifiable information will only be shared with third parties to further the purpose for which you provide such information or when we believe
    in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights of GIGA IMPACTS or its affiliates or subscribers.
</p>
<p>
    If GIGA IMPACTS intends to disclose personally identifiable information to third parties in circumstances not outlined above, you will be advised at the
    time that we request that you provide us such information, such as in the rules of a sweepstakes or contest or as part of the terms of a given promotion,
    and you will be provided with the opportunity to opt out of our online database so that participation in the registration, sweepstakes, contest or other
    activity is possible without disclosing personally identifiable information to such third parties. GIGA IMPACTS does not currently sell any personally
    identifiable information to third parties.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Security</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal
    information, GIGAIMPACTS.COM cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you
    do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use reasonable efforts to ensure that collected personally identifiable information is secure
    and not readily accessible to unapproved individuals or third parties. GIGAIMPACTS.COM has limited the number of people who have physical access to our
    database servers and has implemented electronic security systems and password protections which help further guard against unauthorized access.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed
    in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal
    information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private
    communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Web site. Therefore, although we use industry standard
    practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always
    remain private.
