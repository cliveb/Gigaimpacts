<p>
    North American Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are environmental commodities that can be used to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A REC is a
    multi-attribute commodity that embodies all of the non-energy benefits associated with the generation of renewable energy. A REC can be separated from the
    underlying electricity and applied to other electricity use to substantiate renewable electricity use and ownership. This is different than a carbon
    offset, which is a single-attribute commodity, in that it represents only GHG emissions reductions, which can be separated from an offset project and
    applied to any other GHG-emitting activity.
</p>
<p>
    A renewable energy certificate or REC (known as a renewable energy credit in California) represents the environmental attributes of 1 MWh (mega watt hour –
    or 1,000 kilowatt hours kWh) of renewably generated power. Most RECs are unbundled, i.e., traded separately from the underlying electrical energy. The
    electricity, once stripped of its REC, is then considered non-renewable power and assigned average emissions characteristics. RECs provide renewable energy
    generators with revenue separate from their power sales. RECs provide their customers the right to claim renewable energy use.
</p>
<p>
    RECs are sold directly by the generator to a wholesaler, or by a broker or marketer on the retail market. Buyers include voluntary purchasers such as
    corporations or institutions with environmental commitments, distribution utilities that are required to comply with state renewable portfolio standards
    (RPS), distribution utilities that provide green power options to their customers and green power marketers that sell renewably generated power directly to
    electricity consumers.

<h2>
    How the REC Market Works
</h2>
<p>
    Voluntary buyers retire their RECs in order to make environmental performance claims, while utilities submit proof of retirement to state regulators to
    demonstrate compliance. Compliance buyers must follow specific state rules for REC eligibility, which include requirements for type of generation,
    location, year generated, and other criteria.
</p>
<p>
    Most RECs are tracked and verified by regional REC tracking systems linked with independent system operators or other electricity market monitors. For
    example, in the West, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council maintains the Western Region Electricity Generation Information System. These systems
    track RECs as they’re generated, and the REC owners, who are participants in the tracking system, can transfer them to purchasers who can then move them
into retirement accounts to demonstrate compliance with a state mandate, or to demonstrate delivery to a voluntary retail customer.    <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Sales of voluntary RECs are tracked and verified by independent third parties, most commonly the Center for Resource Solutions’ Green-e Energy program.
    Green-e Energy relies on tracking systems, as well as audit procedures to assure that consumers, who generally do not have REC tracking system accounts,
    are receiving the RECs they purchase from sellers, be they distribution companies, REC marketers or competitive green power suppliers.

    Green-e® Energy
</h2>
<p>
    Green-e Energy, the leading North American renewable energy certification program, certified 99% of total retail REC sales in 2010,and defines a REC as
    including the full suite of environmental and social attributes of the renewable generation. Though state REC definitions sometimes vary, most states that
    use RECs for Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) policy also require that all renewable energy attributes or claims remain bundled with the REC.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What claims can customers make with a REC, and can customers use a REC to make a carbon claim?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    RECs can be used to show the use of renewable energy, and that no carbon emissions are associated with that electricity consumption. A REC purchaser
    therefore can claim to use zero-emissions electricity, claim zero emissions for their electricity consumption, or claim to have avoided the carbon
    emissions associated with consumption of conventional electricity use. A REC purchaser can also claim and report the emissions that are avoided on the
    electricity grid as a result of the generation of that MWh of renewable energy as a (Scope 2) benefit of their purchase. But RECs do not serve the same
    function or convey the same claim as carbon offsets. RECs cannot be used to claim ownership of GHG reductions that can be separated from the electricity
    sector and used to offset non-electricity-related GHG emissions, and there is no claim to have caused reductions to occur beyond a business-as-usual
    scenario. Rather, RECs convey a claim of ownership of zero-emissions energy, the generation of which avoided emissions on the grid, provided there is no
    cap on emissions.
</p>
<p>
    It is inappropriate for projects or marketers to sell RECs as offsets, which would be to sell or market them as a commodity that can address
    non-electricity-related (Scope 1 or 3) 3 emissions, since the facility and emissions reductions associated with that MWh of generation have not necessarily
    been proven to meet offset standards, specifically additionality. It is likewise also inappropriate to sell offsets as renewable energy or RECs, as offsets
    do not convey the suite of benefits associated with renewable energy (see the following question for more information). Center for Resource Solutions (CRS)
    administers consumer protection programs that help protect against inappropriate or misleading marketing claims for both RECs—Green-e® Energy—and
    offsets—Green-e Climate. This role for RECs is well established in the market. In addition to CRS, organizations that endorse using RECs for Scope 2 carbon
